# Muti-omics  

## In the RNAseq_data file,    
Run nt_rnaseq_deseq2 then we get Figure01 and Figure02  
Run nt_rnaseq then we get Figure03 and tf_heat  

## In the ATACseq_data file,   
Run nt_atacseq_pm then we get Figure04  
Run nt_atacseq_gb then we get Figure05  
Run nt_atacseq_dis then we get Figure06  

Run venn then we get Figure07  

## In the ChIPseq_data file,  
Run chip_nor then we get standardized ChIPseq data, the outputs were generated in nor_data file.    
Run chip then we get ChIPseq figures of time series analysis.    

## In the Omics file,  
Run omics then we get Figure omics_mer_2pm, omics_mer_2gb, omics_mer_2dis
