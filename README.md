# Muti-omics  

## In the RNAseq_data file    
Run nt_rnaseq_deseq2 then we get Figure01 and Figure02.  
Run nt_rnaseq then we get Figure03 and tf_heat.  

## In the ATACseq_data file   
Run nt_atacseq_pm then we get Figure04.  
Run nt_atacseq_gb then we get Figure05.  
Run nt_atacseq_dis then we get Figure06.  

Run venn then we get Figure07.  

## In the ChIPseq_data file  
Run chip_nor then we get standardized ChIPseq data, the outputs were generated in nor_data file.    
Run chip then we get ChIPseq figures of time series analysis.    

## In the Omics file  
Run omics then we get Figure omics_mer_2pm, omics_mer_2gb, omics_mer_2dis.    

## In the ML file  
Run ML then we generated the csv of omics_pm, omics_gb, omics_dis.  
Run python_code by python then we generated the figures in ML1.
